## The assignment

Download this repo and edit the Javascript inside `index.html`.

* The function needs to add 3 numbers which are passed along through its parameters
* The function itself has to log the result of the sum to the console Ã¡nd return a true or false
* The function only returns true if the result is higher than 10
* In the `console.log` expression, you'll see a technique called [Template Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). Just an easy way to put variables along text inside a single line.
